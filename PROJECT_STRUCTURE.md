## Persistence Layer: UnitOfWork

- **Class:** `UnitOfWork` (in `Gigbuds_BE.Infrastructure.Persistence`)
- **Method:** `TryCompleteAsync()`
  - [HYP] Hypothesis: A 'try' variant of the commit method should attempt to save changes and return 0 on failure, logging the exception, to provide a safe, non-throwing alternative to `CompleteAsync()`.
  - [VER] Verification: Confirmed via Microsoft Docs ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)) and CodeProject ([source](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5377618/Unit-of-Work-Pattern-in-Csharp-for-Clean-Architect)).
  - [DAT] Implementation: Catches exceptions from `_dbContext.SaveChangesAsync()`, logs the error, and returns 0 if an error occurs.
  - [RES] Result: Provides a robust, non-throwing save method for transactional operations, with error logging for diagnostics.

## Observations

- [DAT] The method is not part of the IUnitOfWork interface, indicating it is an internal convenience for error-tolerant save operations.
- [DAT] Logging is performed using the injected `ILoggerFactory` for traceability.

// Dry technical comment: The universe remains deterministic, but exceptions are now less catastrophic.

## Application Layer: CreateJobShiftsCommandHandler

- **Class:** `CreateJobShiftsCommandHandler` (in `Gigbuds_BE.Application.Features.Schedules.JobShifts.Commands.CreateJobShift`)
- **Method:** `Handle(CreateJobShiftsCommand, ILogger, IUnitOfWork)`
  - [HYP] Hypothesis: Using a foreach loop for inserting job shifts is more idiomatic and avoids side effects compared to LINQ Select. Fetching the repository once before the loop is more efficient.
  - [VER] Verification: Confirmed via C# best practices and Microsoft documentation ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/when-to-use-foreach-vs-select)).
  - [DAT] Implementation: Refactored to use foreach, repository fetched once, and dry technical comment added for scientific rigor.
  - [RES] Result: Improved code clarity, maintainability, and efficiency. The universe remains deterministic, and job shifts are inserted with maximum scientific decorum.

// Dry technical comment: Side effects in LINQ are now a thing of the past. Order is restored to the cosmos.
